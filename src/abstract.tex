The low cost of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices, as well as the high performance and efficiency, makes them an attractive option for applications with strict reliability constraints. Then, COTS devices are used in a wide range of domains, from consumer to HPC and autonomous vehicles. However, the manufacturing process of the COTS chip employs cheap natural Boron making COTS devices highly susceptible to errors induced by thermal neutrons.

We show, using radiation beam experiments with high energy and thermal neutrons, that the thermal neutrons threat is as significant as the high energy one. The evaluation includes devices used in several domains: an AMD APU, two NVIDIA GPUS, an Intel Xeon Phi, and an FPGA. Moreover, we discuss neutron flux, which is fundamental to measure the actual error rate and demonstrate, using a thermal neutron detector, that surrounding materials such as a concrete floor and water from cooling systems, significantly increases the thermal neutron flux.
